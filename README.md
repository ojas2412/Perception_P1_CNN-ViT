Imports, Data Visualization
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Vision Transformer
Adversarial Attacks

In each of these main headings, you can find the sub-headings related to each section of our project report description. 
All the code has been written with PyTorch.
The code has been sequentially compiled, with links between sections and a few outputs have been shown for demonstration.
